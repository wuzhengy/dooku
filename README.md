Count Dooku has a solar sail space-ship to travel the stars. We would not only use that for sailing but also to harvest electricity for compute and communication. In a few years, the solar system will be full of space vehicles, which all needs eletrcity. We believe that we are the first community to bring about solar sail for space solar energy.
